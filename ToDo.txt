Dhcpd:
If a dhcpd has only one staticmap on a interface it crashes the script: 
    Write-Error: Method invocation failed because [System.Collections.Hashtable] does not contain a method named 'Split'.
Add is done by the interface, if we set that to a fixed IPaddress, it is added to the dhcpd, if we set it to dhcp it is deleted from the dhcpd

DhcpStaticMap:
Done
